The program takes your Instagram username and password, then generates two files: followers.txt and following.txt. Each time you rerun it (for example, five days later), the old files are automatically moved into an archive folder, while the new ones overwrite the originals. The Java program then reads all saved .txt files and compares them over time using different data structures and algorithms to track changes.
